# Guess The Number

## Problem Statement

In the scope of this project, I developed a Python program tasked with generating a random number within the range of 1 to 100. The program engages the user in a guessing game, prompting them to predict the generated number. As part of its functionality, the program delivers feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess was too high or too low. Simultaneously, the program maintains a record of the number of guesses made by the user until they successfully identify the correct answer.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1: The random module is imported.
- Step 2: A function is created with the limit of lowest = 1 and highest = 100.
- Step 3: Input is taken from the player by asking the number of trying to solve.
- Step 4: The option for quitting the game is provided.
- Step 5: Finally the function is called.

### Result

If the user successfully guesses the number, a congratulatory message is printed. And, if the user runs out of attempts, the program displays the number of attempts made and shows the correct number.
